This project demonstrates **how to detect and investigate brute force and malware attacks** using a cloud-based environment. The project was hosted on **Vultr**, where I set up an `ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)`, performed _attacks_, and configured automated _alerts_ and _dashboards_ to monitor activity.

### Overview

*   **Platform: Vultr (Cloud)**
*   **Tools Used: ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana), Mythic C2, Sysmon, Ticketing System**
*   **Key Skills: SIEM setup, log ingestion, threat detection, incident response, dashboard creation, alert configuration**

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
